# VBF Live Sub Counter
## A live subcount built for VidBitFuture by @geekyweirdguy, AM, and Blake (Eighty8.)

### So... what does it do?
It gives a live check on how many subscribers a user has. Duh.

The VBF Live Count implements our user API to automatically check the amount of subscribers you have. Here, we've released the code for developers to make their own widgets and sites using our Live Count. 

### Why would I need this?
I don't know... maybe to provide a live and accurate sub count that updates automatically every one and a half seconds..? Yep.

### And how would I enjoy this?
Because you could make stuff. And see your stats. Just about it!

### Developers' Note:
Enjoy the live sub counter and help improve onto it!
